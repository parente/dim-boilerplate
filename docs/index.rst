The dim-boilerplate is a starting point for building web based adventure games using the same basic speech, sound, image, text, and keyboard support as `Descent Into Madness`_. This documentation describes how you can build-out the boilerplate to meet your game needs in successively more flexible, interactive but complex ways.
